# pgmacs.el -- Emacs editing PostgreSQL databases

[![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPL%20v2-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0)

This library provides an editing interface for the PostgreSQL üêò object-relational DBMS from Emacs.
It allows you to:

- browse the **list of tables** in the database

- browse the contents of a table, row by row

- edit the value of a column (type `RET` on the value you want to modify)



## Get started

You will need the pg-el library installed, available in [MELPA](https://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install RET pg

Load this library, then say 

    M-x pgmacs-open-db
    
which will prompt you for a database name and a user. To specify additional arguments such as a
password, a host other than `localhost` and a port other than 5432, call the function

    (pgmacs-open-db "database-name" "username" "password "localhost" 5433)



## Status

This library is in **alpha status**. Please only use it on test databases that do not contain important
data. 

The library has been tested with PostgreSQL version 16.2, but should work with any PostgreSQL version
supported by the [pg-el library](https://github.com/emarsden/pg-el/) that it uses to communicate
with PostgreSQL. The code has been tested with Emacs 29.2 on Linux. It requires version 29.x because
it uses the `vtable` library.
