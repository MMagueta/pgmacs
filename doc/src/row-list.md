# Displaying a database table: the row-list buffer

A **row-list buffer** shows some metainformation on the table and its columns, then the row data in
tabular form, as illustrated below.

If the table contains a large number of rows, the contents will be **paginated**, with `Next` and
`Previous` buttons to move page by page. The number of rows in each page is determined by the
variable `pgmacs-row-limit`.

A column which is a part of a primary key will be displayed using the customizable
`pgmacs-column-primary-key` face, which defaults to a bold version of the `pgmacs-table-data` face.
A column which references a foreign key will be displayed using the `pgmacs-column-foreign-key`
face, which defaults to a blue color.

The following keys are bound when the point is located in the row-list table:

| Key                             | Binding                                                                              |

## Follow foreign key references

A column that references data in a foreign table (`FOREIGN KEY`) will be shown in blue. If you type
<kbd>RET</kbd> when point is located on a foreign key reference, PGmacs will jump to the referenced
row and column in the other table. A new row-list buffer is opened; type <kbd>q</kbd> to come back
to the original row-list buffer.
